# Catch The Dot
This project implements a game in which you have to catch the dot with your index finger.
A dot of a certain size appears on the screen at a random position.
Once you touch the dot with the tip of your index finger, your score will increase by one and a new dot will appear.
The player can use both hands to catch the dot, or other players can join with their hands.
In the CatchTheDot-file, there are no seperate scores for multiple players, i.e. either player catching the dot leads to an increase of the same score.
However, in the extended version, the game keeps track of two different scores when two different hands are used.

This project is implemented assuming the front-camera of a device since it mirrors the received image.
